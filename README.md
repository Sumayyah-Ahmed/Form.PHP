# Form.PHP
I am pleased to present my initial PHP form, developed using HTML, CSS, and PHP. This form is designed for straightforward data collection and does not currently interface with a database.
The form incorporates essential fields for name, email address, and a message, all of which are mandatory. Input validation is implemented to ensure data integrity. Upon successful submission, the user receives a positive confirmation message. Conversely, if the form is submitted with invalid data (via incorrect email format or missing required fields), an appropriate error message is displayed, highlighting the specific field(s) requiring correction. For enhanced user experience, error messages are rendered in red, while success messages appear in green.

I invite you to test the functionality of this form created by Sumayyah Ahmed!
